Draw scene and provide a 1st person, perspective, and orthoganal view of said scene

Key bindings
  1			 		           Select 1st person view
  2			 		           Select Perspective View
  3			 		           Select Orthogonal View
  +/-        		       Changes field of view for perspective
  a          		       Toggle axes
  arrows(modes 2 & 3)  Change view angle

  arrows(mode 1)     	 FPV:
                        up and down arrows move the view forward and backward in scene
                        left and right arrows rotate views central focus point
                        
  PgDn/PgUp or w/s     Zoom in and out
  0          	    	   Reset view angle
  ESC        		       Exit


!!!Notes!!!

-When switching between 1st person and other views camera view is changed, but switching between orthogonal and perspective views results in the same viewing angle as outlined by the instructions for the assignment.

-Using the arrows to navigate in mode 1 will move you along the x and z axis of the scene, no matter your orientation. It is best to move in the starting angle ('th' or azimuth = 0).
